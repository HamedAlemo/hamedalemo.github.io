In this podcast, I talked to [Heather (Dunlop) Couture](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hdcouture/) about Foundation Models for Earth Observation. There are several different foundation models for EO, and we discussed the applications of these models, how to choose the right one for a given project, and ethical considerations for using them responsibly.
