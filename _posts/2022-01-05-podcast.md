In this episode of Practical AI podcast, together with [Joyce Nakatumba-Nabende](https://sites.google.com/view/jnabende/home) (Scientific Head of the [Makerere Artificial Intelligence Lab](https://air.ug/)) and former colleague Abba Barde, we sat down with 
DANIEL WHITENACK and Chris Benson and talked about the landscape if AI solutions in Africa. In particular, we discussed the role of Radiant Earth Foundation and open data policies to advance the impact of AI across the continent. We highlighted how open Earth Observation data can support Africa's progress toward meeting UN Sustainable Development Goals, and how AI-based applications can be used in these data scarce regions.
