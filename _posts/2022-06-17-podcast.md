In this podcast, I talked to [Drew Wheadon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewwheadon/) from Tetra Tech who is the Program Manager for [the Enabling Crop Analytics at Scale](https://cropanalytics.net/), an initiative of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. We talked about the data value chain in the agricultural sector from collection on the ground to enabling analysis.
